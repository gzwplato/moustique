# Moustique


UCI chess engine written in Pascal by Roland Chastain.

Moustique is a chess program with a console interface respecting the Universal Chess Interface protocol.

Moustique is an assembly of two independent programs: one who searches the best move, the other who searches only checkmate.

The standard chess program is an adaptation of a program by JÃ¼rgen Schlottke. The mate solver is an adaptation of a program by Valentin Albillo.
